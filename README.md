# ALX Low-level Programming

With a static type system, C is an imperative procedural language that supports structured programming, lexical variable scoping, and recursion. With the least amount of runtime support, it was intended to be built to offer low-level memory access and language features that easily map to machine instructions. The language was intended to promote cross-platform programming despite its low-level capabilities. A standards-compliant C program built with portability in mind can be compiled for a number of computing platforms and operating systems with little source code changes.

This project features a chronology of the C Language structure and syntax, from variables to loops, functions, pointers and arrays, memory allocation and so on.
